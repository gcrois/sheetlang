// Simple Array
A1 = [1, 2, 3]           // = [1, 2, 3]

// Array Indexing (0-based)
B1 = A1[0]               // = 1
B2 = A1[2]               // = 3

// Out of bounds (Returns empty)
B3 = A1[99]              // = empty

// Nested Arrays
C1 = [[10, 20], [30, 40]]
// Indexing nested array (requires Tick 2 to resolve C1 first if referencing)
// But here we are indexing the literal structure essentially
C2 = C1[1]               // = [30, 40]

// Chained Indexing (if supported by parser/engine logic)
// Note: Depending on your AST, C1[1][0] might need C1 to be resolved first.
// Since C1 is assigned in Tick 1, C3 reads the value of C1 from Tick 1 (which was empty).
// So C3 will likely be empty at Tick 1 and correct at Tick 2.
C3 = C1[0][0]            // = 10
